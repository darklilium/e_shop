## Test Instructions

The goal of this test is to implement a simple, working shopping cart.

It must have two important sections:

- An Item list, showing a catalog of products that can be added to the cart
- A Cart list, which contains all the items that are going to be purchased by the user.

These are the business rules:

- Each item in the catalog list must have an action button to `add item to cart`.

- Each item added to the cart must have an action button to `remove item from cart`.


Here is a demo video showing how the application should behave when finished:
